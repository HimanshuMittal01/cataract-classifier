# cataract-classifier
Binary classification model to identify cataracts in images deployed via FASTAPI

EfficientNet finetuned model is giving 97% accuracy on the test dataset.

<!-- ## How to run

1. Create python environment

If you are using `uv`:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
``` -->

### Potential Improvements:
- [ ] Setup tensorboard for monitoring
- [ ] Add more metrics - precision, recall, f1-score, classification report, confusion matrix, ROC curve
- [ ] Write API usage documentation with example requests and responses
- [ ] Write a CNN model from scratch
- [ ] [Optional] Provide three model options in the frontend
